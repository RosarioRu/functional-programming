/*
Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

function selectionSort(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {

    let minIndex = i;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (array[j] < array[minIndex]) {
        minIndex = j;
      }     
    }
    [array[i], array[minIndex]] = [array[minIndex], array[i]];
  }
  return array;
